\slide{Maintenance Windows}

This chapter is about planning for large events: major upgrades,
major outages, large-scale events.

The basic strategy is to emulate NASA with a 
\emph{flight-director} approach.

\slide{The Basics}

\bi
\item Scheduling
\item Planning
\item Flight Director
\item Change Proposals
\item The Master Plan
\item Disabling Access
\item Mechanics and Coordination (next slide)
\ei

\slide{Mechanics and Coordination}

\bi
\item Sequence (shutdown/boot)
\item Console service
\item Radios
\ei

\slide{The Basics (cont.)}

\bi
\item Deadlines for Change Completion
\item Comprehensive System Testing
\item Postmaintenance Communication
\item Re-enable Remote Access
\item Visible Presence the Next Morning (\emph{key})
\item Postmortem (\emph{key})
\ei
 
\slide{The Icing}

\bi
\item Mentoring a New Flight Director
\item Trending of Historical Data
\item Providing Limited Availability (\emph{hard})
\item High-Availability Sites
\ei

\slide{The Nines}

\bi
\item 99.9\% (9 hours down per year)
\item 99.99\% (1 hour per year)
\item 99.999\% (aka \emph{5 nines}) (5 minutes per year)
\item 99.9999\% (aka \emph{6 nines}) (1 minute per year)
\ei

\slide{High Availability Sites}

\bi
\item The basics are the same as usual
\item Redundancy is a prerequisite
\item No need to disable access
\item No need for a full shutdown/boot list, although one
  interesting exercise is to reboot the entire plant
\ei

\slide{Conclusion}

\bi
\item Preparation
\item Execution
\item Postmaintenance customer care
\ei

The military says: "Proper planning prevents poor performance."  That
saying holds true in the SAs world, too.
