\slide{Assignment}

\item Designing a datacenter is very dependent on a person's tastes.
Take either Tom or Christine's ideal datacenter description and
critique it according to your perspective.  If you like, you can make a 
spreadsheet using the topics discussed in Chapter 17, Tom or Christine's
design for that feature, and then your comments on that design.
\item Read: PSNA Chapters 21-24.
