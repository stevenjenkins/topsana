\item Politics was involved
\item Global: not just a campus (scale down as well as up)
\item Attempt to use clout to influence vendors
\ei

\slide{Aurora: Key Components}

\bi
\item Global look and feel (Global Desk)

\item Global configuration database (DSDB)
\item Global homogeneous OS configuration
\ei

\slide{Aurora: Global Desk}

The Unix/Linux world is still in this struggle, although 
now there are only two serious players: Gnome and KDE.  Morgan
Stanley chose a vendor that later went out of business, which
resulted in extremely high costs to add additional underlying
platforms.

Profile system provided classes and groups.  Written in KSH, and,
the last I heard, still not ported to anything else.

\slide{Aurora: Global file system}

\bi
\item AFS is still the only serious answer
\item Slightly different semantics
\item Good performance over WANs
\item Morgan Stanley had to build a system (VMS) to manage this
\item Estimated cost of replacing AFS and VMS with something else is 
	around 10 man years, assuming a commercial solution is
	available.

\slide{Aurora: DSDB}

\bi
\item Equivalent to Moira
\item Used NIS (or native name-service system) rather than Hesiod
\ei

\slide{Aurora: OS Configuration}

\bi
\item Rebuild all machines according to standards
\item Basically RCS $+$ {\tt rdist} (or {\tt rsync})
\item Linux added in 6 months of work
\item Very expensive, though, for certain systems (e.g., AIX)
\ei
