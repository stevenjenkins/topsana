\item What is the cost?
\item {\bf Discuss: }Trust the vendor's installation?
\item {\bf Note: } Some systems built your way plus some systems

\item Cloning versus automated install
\item \emph{When you think you've finishing automating something, \
	hand over your system to a junior person to run.}
