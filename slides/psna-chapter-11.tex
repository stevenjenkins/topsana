\slide{Server Upgrades}
How do you upgrade the OS of a single host?

List three ways not to upgrade the OS of a single host.

\slide{Upgrade Process}
\bi
\item Checklist
\item Verification and/or upgrade plan 
\item Develop test plan for each service
\item Back-out plan
\item Select maintenance window
\item Announce the upgrade
\item Execute the tests (dry run)
\ei

\slide{Upgrade Process (cont.)}
\bi
\item Implement the changes, with someone watching
\item Repeat tests
\item If all else fails, back-out
\item Communicate completion/back-out
\ei

\slide{How long, O SA, How Long?}

Your window needs to be:
\bi
\item time upgrade should require
\item plus time testing should take
\item plus time to fix problems
\item plus time to back out
\item plus time to verify back-out
\ei

\emph{Initially, it is best to double or triple your estimates to adjust \
for hubris.}

\slide{Communication}

\bi
\item Use a template that is filled out instead of editing previous 
  announcements.
\item Communication either completion or back-out (silence is \emph{not}
  golden!)
\ei

\slide{Icing}

\bi
\item multiple services (risk/time trade-off)
\item fresh installs
\item reusing tests in monitoring
\item system changelog
\item dress rehearsal
\item old and new versions (default symlinks)
\ei
